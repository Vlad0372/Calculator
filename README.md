# Calculator
So basically it's a standard simple calculator but with one little thing, which implementation was a real challenge for me.

The thing is a bar which shows you your actions history with results (marked with a red border).

In general it's a simple mechanism, but i wanted to do it exactly
how it's done in the Windows Calculator
